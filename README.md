# My-Pixel-Art-
I am going to store all of my pixel art in this repo!

#The-lava-bucket:
This was my entry for the pixel art contest by Shadow Cat on Khan Academy!
This was actually my first time making a program that is only about pixel art! I have used pixel art in my platformer before, but I have not made a program all about pixel art. For this, I decided to make a lava bucket! It was a lot more fun than I thought it would be and it took me a little less than one hour to make!

Credit to google for giving me ideas on how to make a lava bucket.
Credit to Minecraft for originally making the lava bucket texture!
